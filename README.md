# Online_Course_Recommender_System

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation and code for an independent machine learning capstone project. In this project, we explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques to build a recommendation system, analyze data, and predict ratings. The project is a culmination of independent work in the field of machine learning.

## Project Goals

- Compare and contrast different machine learning algorithms.
- Develop a final project using machine learning methods.
- Create recommendation systems using various techniques.
- Gain insights from data analysis.

## Skills Developed

- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Algorithmic Understanding
- Model Evaluation

## Project Sections

The project is organized into several sections, each focusing on specific aspects of machine learning:

- **Section 1: Data Exploration**
  - Explore and visualize the dataset.
  - Understand data patterns and relationships.

- **Section 2: Recommendation Systems**
  - Build recommendation systems using different approaches.
  - Implement collaborative filtering techniques.

- **Section 3: Rating Prediction**
  - Predict course ratings using machine learning models.
  - Evaluate model performance.

- **Section 4: Application Development**
  - Develop an application to showcase the project results.
  - Explore data through a user-friendly interface.
